Since I've been asked a lot about good practices and security things, I decided to implement a simple REST Webapp

I hope you find it useful for your projects. Please take a look at layers, package encapsulation and encrypting practices.

Feel free to fork this project! I'll be glad to get some tips and build a better app.
